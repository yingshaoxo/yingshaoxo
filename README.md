# Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm your friend, yingshaoxo



<!--
**yingshaoxo/yingshaoxo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


### I do open source at Github, making free tutorials at Youtube. If my government won't arrest me, I would also like to share my thoughts on Twitter.

I have a real-life job, but it's not related to programming.

I want to do some part-time jobs in my spare time. Because one day, I wish I could stay alive with coding.

> And also, I love dollars more than RMB.

My power comes from Python, Javascript, Java, Golang, CPP, and so on. But to be honest, I can only use `Reactjs` or `Expo` or `Vuejs` or `Electron` or `Android Studio` or `Keras` or `Linux` or `Github` or `Stackoverflow` to do some development. Yes, I'm not an expert, so sadly.

For what I could do, you could take a look at my repos, except those I forked, they have everything you need to know me.

By the way, contact me with [Gmail](yingshaoxo@gmail.com), don't use some weird soft like WeChat or kinds of. (Best wishes to you if you do)
