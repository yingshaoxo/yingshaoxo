# Hi there 👋 I'm your friend, yingshaoxo

Freedom is do whatever you want without disturb others.

But censorship and false report will destroy your freedom.

How do you fight back against evil people and platform and dictators and monopoly organization?

You create your own version of stuff. DIY everything you use. (Do it yourself)

To seek for independence and freedom, you have to reduce dependencies and find more alternatives.

<!-- Got a part time job recentely
I'm looking for a way to constantly improve my English speaking ability. (Advanced Level for Commercial Usage)

So if you are a native English speaker, you can contact me to invite me to work for you as a part-time coder or researcher.

All you have to pay is spent 10 minutes per day to practice English with me (I mean, a real time conversation, in the form of audio or video).

**yingshaoxo/yingshaoxo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


### I do open source at Github, making free tutorials at Youtube. If my government won't arrest me, I would also like to share my thoughts on Twitter.

I have a real-life job, but it's not related to programming.

I want to do some part-time jobs in my spare time. Because one day, I wish I could stay alive with coding.

> And also, I love dollars more than RMB.

My power comes from Python, Javascript, Dart, Java, Golang, CPP, and so on. But to be honest, I can only use `Flutter` or `Reactjs` or `Expo` or `Vuejs` or `Electron` or `Android Studio` or `Keras` or `Linux` or `Github` or `Stackoverflow` to do some development. Yes, I'm not an expert, so sadly.

For what I could do, you could take a look at my repos, except those I forked, they have everything you need to know me.

By the way, contact me with [Gmail](yingshaoxo@gmail.com), don't use some weird soft like WeChat or kinds of. (Best wishes to you if you do)
