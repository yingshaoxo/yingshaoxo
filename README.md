# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm your friend, yingshaoxo

I can code with Python, Typescript, CPP, Dart.

<!-- Got a part time job recentely
I'm looking for a way to constantly improve my English speaking ability. (Advanced Level for Commercial Usage)

So if you are a native English speaker, you can contact me to invite me to work for you as a part-time coder or researcher.

All you have to pay is spent 10 minutes per day to practice English with me (I mean, a real time conversation, in the form of audio or video).

### I do open source at Github, making free tutorials at Youtube. If my government won't arrest me, I would also like to share my thoughts on Twitter.

I have a real-life job, but it's not related to programming.

I want to do some part-time jobs in my spare time. Because one day, I wish I could stay alive with coding.

> And also, I love dollars more than RMB.

My power comes from Python, Javascript, Dart, Java, Golang, CPP, and so on. But to be honest, I can only use `Flutter` or `Reactjs` or `Expo` or `Vuejs` or `Electron` or `Android Studio` or `Keras` or `Linux` or `Github` or `Stackoverflow` to do some development. Yes, I'm not an expert, so sadly.

For what I could do, you could take a look at my repos, except those I forked, they have everything you need to know me.

By the way, contact me with [Gmail](yingshaoxo@gmail.com), don't use some weird soft like WeChat or kinds of. (Best wishes to you if you do)
